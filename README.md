<blockquote>
<p>Brave knight!!! What is your name?<em>John</em><br>
We are in need of your help, John!<br>
Our village is being overrun by the goblins of the NorthernCaves.<br>
We need you to defeat them!<br>
Will you accept the challenge(Y/N)?<em><strong>N</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I set the system is able to beg one time. So when the knight says no for the first time, it needs one more time for the program to exit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…. Please, please help us brave knight, are you ready to enter the mouth of the caves (Y/N)? <em><strong>Y</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer here is insensitive to the cases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are now entering the mouth of the cave, what would you like to do?<br>
1) Attack the evil Marcel and clean up all the cob webs<br>
2) Pick up the golden sword<br>
<strong>1</strong><br>
You slayed the evil Marcel and are sill alive, what would you like to do?<br>
1) Move on to the next adventure<br>
2) Pick up the golden sword</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you select the first option here, you will be prompted out and game is over!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>1</strong></em><br>
You failed to pick up the treasure, game over!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Process finished with exit code 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you can only select the second one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>2</strong></em><br>
Oh, my knight! You are still alive and can get ready for the next adventure<br>
You have ventured deeper into the cave, what would you like to do?<br>
1) Move on to the next adventure<br>
<em><strong>1</strong></em><br>
You have ventured deeper into the cave, what would you like to do?<br>
1) Attack the evil Limpian and turn off the water supply<br>
2) Pick up the golden shield<br>
<em><strong>2</strong></em><br>
You have picked up the treasure, now go rest before continuing the mission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The song below will be randomly printed out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Old MacDonald had a farm e-i-e-i-o.<br>
And on this farm he had a pig e-i-e-i o<br>
With a quack-quack here and quack-quack there<br>
Here a quack there a quack everywhere a quack-quack</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You have picked up the gold shield and are still alive, what would you like to do?<br>
1) Move on to the next adventure<br>
2) Attack the evil Limpian and turn off the water supply<br>
<em><strong>2</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the adventure was tricked, the scenario when you wake up will be like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great! You are awake and rested what would you like to do?<br>
1) Attack the hobgoblin lord DivaDon<br>
2) Pick up the silver tray of life<br>
<em><strong>2</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you choose the second option by mistake, then you will suffer the penance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are tricked! And now you have to do the penance.<br>
Choose the punishment you want.<br>
1) Sing Twelve Days of Christmas<br>
2) Solve out 5 equations<br>
<em><strong>1</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You have picked up the option 1, now you need to  sing the song Sing Twelve Days of Christmas totally correctly.</p>
<p>Now sing it loud!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are ordered to type in the lyrics totally correctly, so I give the version that’s designed within the codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me, a partridge in a pear tree</li>
<li>On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree"</li>
<li>On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me, three French hens, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree</li>
<li>On the fourth day of Christmas My true love gave to me Four calling birds Three French hens Two turtle doves And a partridge in a pear tree</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose the second one,  you will not pass through this challenge until you solve out 5 equations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have picked up the option 2, here are the problem you are going to solve.<br>
70+15=</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After you passed through the three adventures, here comes the final challenge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes! Now there is only the final mission left, ready go!<br>
